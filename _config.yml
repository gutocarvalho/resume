<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I have been here a long time. I started to work with computers back in the &#39;90s. My first OS was MS-DOS 6.0, and my first window manager was Windows 3.1. I used to connect to the internet using those noisy 14.400mbps modems from US Robotics, and IRC was the best way to chat with our friends :)</p></p>

<p>I have a sysadmin soul plus network and Linux skills combined with agile culture, I&#39;m also a DevOps Enthusiast, GitOps Practitioner, and Cloud-Native believer.</p></p>

<p>I&#39;ve done so many things during my digital journey. I&#39;ve worked as a Sysadmin, Network engineer, Linux engineer, Advisor for the Federal Government, Consultor, Entrepreneur, Infrastructure developer (Infra as code), and GitOps engineer. Now I&#39;m working as a Cloud Native Engineer, currently living in Brasília, DF, Brazil.</p></p>

<p>My interests range from infrastructure as code (IaC), DevOps, GitOps, Kubernetes, Cloud Native, ChatOps, Continuous Delivery, and Agile principles.</p></p>

<h3>My goals</h3>

<p>I want to help companies extract more from their infrastructure, innovate, and seek creative and intelligent solutions that add value to their projects and products.</p>

<h3>Exciting things from my work</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>In 2011, I presented an automation case using IaC inside the Brazilian Executive Federal Government, probably the first one.</p></li>
<li><p>I was part of the team that built the first private cloud of Itaú, one of the largest banks in Brazil. </p></li>
<li><p>In one of my recent projects, I was able to help the Ministry of Health enter the Cloud Native era. I designed the architecture and deployed five k8s clusters for their APPs and systems (dev, stg, test, pre-prod, prod), now they are moving from legacy to Cloud Native.</p></li>
<li><p>I held two devopsdays in Brasilia city, Brazil&#39;s Capital, my city.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve trained more than 500 people on IaC in the last 10 years.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve been blogging for almost 15 years about IT and general stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>I love to do mountain bike and karate-do!</p></li>
<li><p>I'm 40 and I have two kids, a dog and a cat :)</p></li>
